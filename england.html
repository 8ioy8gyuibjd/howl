  <p>"Despite making up 14% of the population, BAME [Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic] men and women make up 25% of prisoners, while over 40% of young people in custody are from BAME backgrounds. If our prison population reflected the make-up of England and Wales, we would have over 9,000 fewer people in prison–the equivalent of 12 average-sized prisons. This over-representation of BAME offenders in both the adult and youth estates has an economic and social cost estimated at £234 million a year.
    <br><br>The BAME proportion of young people offending for the first time rose from 11% in 2006 to 19% in 2016 | reoffending rose from 11% to 19% | number of prisoners rose from 25% to 41%.
    <br><br>Muslims in prison have increased by almost 50% over the last decade from 8,900 to 13,200. Muslims now make up 15% of the prison population, but just 5% of the general population. This is a worrying trend and risks becoming a source of social division."
    <br><br>There is greater disproportionality in the number of Black people in prisons here than in the United States. Black boys are more than ten times as likely as White boys to be arrested for drug offences. Black people make up 3% of the general population but 12% of prisoners and 21% of children in custody are Black."

  <p>"The number of people being arrested for ‘online crimes of speech’ have increased dramatically in London. According to the Register, a total of 2,500 Londoners have been arrested over the past five years for allegedly sending ‘offensive’ messages via social media. In 2015, 857 people were detained, up 37 per cent increase since 2010. The Communications Act 2003 defines illegal communication as ‘using public electronic communications network in order to cause annoyance, inconvenience or needless anxiety’. Breaking the law carries a six-month prison term or fine of up to £5,000.
    <br><br>More than 3,300 people were detained and questioned in 2016 over so-called trolling on social media and other online forums, a rise of nearly 50 per cent in two years, according to figures obtained by The Times. About half of the investigations were dropped before prosecutions were brought, however, leading to criticism from civil liberties campaigners that the authorities are over-policing the internet and threatening free speech. Arrests are expected to rise after Amber Rudd, the home secretary, last week announced a national police hub to crack down on hateful material online."

  <p>"Almost 19,000 children have been sexually groomed in England in the past year, according to official figures that have prompted warnings of an ‘epidemic’. Campaigners say the true figure is far higher and accused the government of failing to tackle child sexual exploitation, despite promises made after high-profile cases in Rotherham and Rochdale. High-profile cases included a ‘high proportion of men of Pakistani heritage’ and that ‘cultural reasons’ could be at play.
    <br><br>The Department for Education statistics showed that Lancashire recorded the highest number of children (624) as grooming victims out of any single local authority area, followed by Birmingham (490), Surrey (447), Bradford (414) and Gloucestershire (409)."

  <p>"Rotherham council is to come under central government control after an independent inspection of its handling of child sexual exploitation concluded it was not fit for purpose and was more concerned about protecting its own reputation than its most vulnerable citizens. The cabinet of Rotherham metropolitan borough council (RMBC) immediately announced their intention to resign en masse in the wake of Louise Casey’s scathing report commissioned by the communities secretary, Eric Pickles. Concluding that the council needs a fresh start, Casey’s 154-page report said: ‘The council’s culture is unhealthy: bullying, sexism, suppression and misplaced ‘political correctness’ have cemented its failures. The council is currently incapable of tackling its weaknesses without a sustained intervention.’ She also criticised the council’s deep-rooted culture of suppressing bad news and ignoring hard issues, writing: ‘RMBC goes to some length to cover up information and to silence whistleblowers.’
    <br><br>Her ‘reluctant’ conclusion was that ‘both today and in the past, Rotherham has at times taken more care of its reputation than it has its most needy. She found that council staff and councillors lacked the confidence to tackle difficult issues ‘for fear of being seen as racist or upsetting community cohesion’. Some of Casey’s interviewees talked about a historical context in which RMBC was concerned not to do anything that might be seen as offensive to a minority community. ‘We weren’t allowed to hold forums near pubs because it might upset the Muslim people.’
    <br><br>A current serving officer said: ‘[The politicians] wanted to use any other word than Asian males. They were terrified of [the impact on] community cohesion.’ Though her report focused on failures in RMBC, Casey reserves some opprobrium for South Yorkshire police. ‘There seemed to be lawlessness in relation to CSE in Rotherham. Perpetrators seemed to face no consequences. Nor were their activities disrupted,’ she wrote. The report gives a number of examples of insensitive policing, such as the officer who consoled one victim by saying: ‘Don’t worry – you aren’t the first girl to be raped by XX and you won’t be the last.'"

  <p>"British white people are soon to become the minority in Birmingham [England’s 2nd largest city]. Nearly 50,000 residents in the city cannot speak English. There are thought to be residents from nearly 200 countries living in Birmingham. 42.1% of people in Birmingham classified themselves as non-white British in the 2011 census compared to 12% in 2001. If the rate continues, half of the city's 1.2 million-plus population will be from an ethnic minority in 2021. This is already the case for under 18s with 60% coming from a non-white British background in the last poll. The city's varied ethnicity has been identified as major factor in social segregation and community 'tension’.

  <p>"Most Muslims (83%) – and, indeed, most Britons regardless of religion (66%) - agree that ‘it is possible to fully belong to Britain and maintain a separate cultural or religious identity.’
    <br><br>A 2016 poll gave Muslim respondents four options to choose between as ‘the ideal way for you to lead your life in Britain today’. 53% chose ‘I would like to fully integrate with non-Muslims in all aspects of life’ | 37% that ‘I would like to integrate on most things, but there should be separation in some areas, such as Islamic schooling and laws’. In a 2015 poll, 17% said ‘I would like to integrate on some things, but I would prefer to lead a separate Islamic life as far as possible’, and only 1% that ‘I would like to live in a fully separate Islamic area in Britain, subject to Sharia law and government’. One survey found that 31% agree, but 66% disagree, that they would like their children to go to a Muslim state school if they had a choice. 45% agree that they would prefer to send their child to a school with strong Muslim values.
    <br><br>A 2015 poll found that 23% of Muslims would support there being areas of Britain where Sharia law is introduced instead of British law while 43% would oppose it | in this case 10% answered ‘don’t know’ and 24% that they would neither support nor oppose it. A 2016 ICM survey of Muslims asked a question about Sharia Law in more detail about areas of law where it could be introduced such as those ‘related to civil law cases such as financial disputes, divorce or other family matters but which could also cover other aspects’. Asked in this way, support for Sharia law increases to 43% with 22% saying they oppose this and a similar proportion (23%) saying they ‘neither support or oppose’ it and 12% saying ‘don’t know’.
