  <p>"Biden proposed the U.S. Citizenship Act on the very first day of his administration; the next month it was formally introduced in the House and Senate... it’s all about amnesty and paths to citizenship. There is little about preventing illegal immigration. In fact, like most of the Democrats’ policies towards immigration, it would almost certainly increase the number of people arriving at the southern border, not drive it down.<br><br>
    Create an earned roadmap to citizenship for undocumented individuals. This section allows all illegals to gain temporary legal status immediately and apply for a green card within five years. Three years after that they can become citizens. Further, 'Dreamers, TPS holders, and immigrant farmworkers' are eligible for green cards immediately. Oh, and also: the government is replacing the term 'alien' with 'noncitizen.'<br><br>
    instead of erecting barriers to entry, physical or virtual, the White House focuses on the ability to 'process' migrants faster."

  <p>"The Center for Immigration Studies found last year from January 2023 to December 2023, at least 320,000 illegal immigrants were allowed to fly into the U.S. from their home country through a controversial program of the Biden administration using the Customs and Border Patrol app, the CBP One app that was created to let migrants apply for parole into the US."

  <p>"More than 1.5 million illegal migrants have slipped into the US since Joe Biden took office — more than three times the number recorded during the last three years of Trump’s presidency, Department of Homeland Security data shows."

  <p>"A divided Supreme Court on Monday allowed Border Patrol agents to cut razor wire that Texas installed on the U.S.-Mexico border, while a lawsuit over the wire continues.
    The justices, by a 5-4 vote, granted an emergency appeal from the Biden administration, which has been in an escalating standoff at the border with Texas and had objected to an appellate ruling in favor of the state."

  <p>"The Biden administration on Monday filed a lawsuit against Texas over floating barriers that state officials have deployed in the middle of the Rio Grande, seeking to force the state to remove the buoys that federal officials argue have endangered migrants and Border Patrol agents alike.
    The Justice Department's nine-page lawsuit, filed in the federal district court in Austin, said Texas officials were required to request and obtain permission from the federal government before assembling the barriers, which were put in place earlier this month. The river buoys, the department argued, violate a long-standing federal law that governs structures in navigable waterways. The suit asked the court to direct Texas to remove the existing river buoys and to block the state from setting up similar barriers in the future."

  <p>"The dispute between Texas and federal officials continues as the White House and lawmakers challenge Texas’ policies, including a new law that deems entering the state illegally a state crime. Disagreements over the issue has also caused a ripple effect in states where migrants have been sent by Texas officials."<br>

  <p>"Nearly every other region of the world — including Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, Europe, South America and Central America — saw increasing numbers of unauthorized immigration to the U.S. The largest increases in immigration came from Central America as well as South and East Asia... Because more people of various ethnic populations are coming to the U.S., Rodriguez said this creates wider social networks that encourage further immigration."

  <p>"The US government is suing Arizona's governor over the construction of a makeshift barrier made of shipping containers at the US-Mexico border.
    Governor Doug Ducey began building the barrier earlier this year, saying it was an attempt to 'secure' the border.
    But in its lawsuit, the government claimed Arizona was trespassing on federal lands.
    Hundreds of thousands of people have been detained while attempting to cross the border in recent months."

  <p>"Senegalese people accounted for more than 9,000 arrests in Tucson from Oct. 1 to Dec. 9, while arrests of people from Guinea and India each topped 4,000. Agents have encountered migrants from about four dozen Eastern hemisphere countries... Most are released with notices to appear in immigration courts, which are backlogged with more than 3
    million cases."

  <p>"A remote desert region along the southern border has become a makeshift international arrivals area for thousands of migrants... Many expect to be released into the U.S. after being vetted by local Border Patrol agents, who lack the resources and manpower to screen everyone in a timely manner... Most of the migrant men hailed from African countries, including Guinea, Mauritania, Morocco and Senegal, as well as some nations in Asia like Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Syria. Some men had left their hometowns in Ecuador and other parts of Latin America."

  <p>"CBP reported as many as 10,000 people entering the country illegally every day through the southwest border... CBP closed a port of entry in Lukeville, Arizona, a pedestrian crosswalk in San Diego, and an international bridge in Eagle Pass, Texas... Union Pacific estimates the total losses for all impacted industries - in goods, wages and transportation costs - in excess of $200 million a day."

  <p>"The number of illegal immigrants in the country has roughly doubled under President Joe Biden. The United States had some 10.2 million illegal immigrants in 2020, and another 10 million have entered during Biden’s presidency. If the 20 million illegal immigrants were all in one state, it would be tied with New York for the fourth most populated state."

  <p>"On Wednesday, Mayorkas announced temporary legal status for an estimated 472,000 Venezuelans who had arrived in the country as of July 31 — including some who ignored his stern warnings and came illegally. Circumstances change, but the Biden administration’s sharp expansion of Temporary Protected Status may complicate its messaging... The recent announcement of status for 472,000 Venezuelans came on top of more than 242,000 who were previously covered under TPS grants in 2021 and 2022.<br><br>Under Mayorkas’ watch, TPS grew to cover more than 600,000 people from 16 countries as of the end of March, according to the Congressional Research Service. On Thursday, the secretary extended protections to an estimated 14,600 Afghans, on top of the 3,100 who already had them... Venezuelans were stopped 25,777 times the first 17 days of September, up 63% from the same period a month earlier. Those included some people admitted for scheduled asylum appointments, but the vast majority were illegal entries."

  <p>"Experts say the U.S. lacks the capacity to detain and process migrants at the border, often making it impossible for the administration to carry out the harsh penalties it announced in May.
    As a result, some asylum seekers who cross illegally are being released into the U.S. with a future court date, rather than being deported - becoming success stories repeated back to migrants still en route... An unprecedented number of migrants entering Mexico hail from other continents, as the trek to the U.S. southern border increasingly becomes a global migration route... The number of African migrants registered by Mexican authorities so far this year is already three times as high as during all 2022."

  <p>"More than 1 million people have been allowed to enter the U.S. under Biden administration programs... Since President Biden took office in 2021, his administration has used immigration parole at a historic scale, invoking the decades-old law to welcome hundreds of thousands of foreigners fleeing armed conflicts in Afghanistan and Ukraine, or political and economic crises in countries like Haiti and Venezuela.<br><br>
    Internal federal statistics as of Jan. 18 show the Biden administration has invoked the parole authority to admit 422,000 migrants who used a government phone app known as CBP One to schedule a time to be processed at an official U.S.-Mexico border crossing... Officials have also used parole to welcome 340,000 Haitians, Cubans, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans at airports under a Biden administration program that allows U.S.-based individuals to sponsor them, according to the internal data.<br><br>
    Following the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in the summer of 2021, the Biden administration cited the parole authority to resettle more than 77,000 Afghans, most of whom were airlifted from Kabul... The Biden administration has used parole in other contexts, including to release hundreds of thousands of migrants who crossed the southern border illegally in 2021 and 2022 under a policy that was struck down in federal court."<br>

  <p>"Mayor Eric Adams escalated his rhetoric over the migrant crisis on Wednesday night, claiming in stark terms that New York City was being destroyed by an influx of migrants from the southern border and saying that he did not see a way to fix the issue.
    'Let me tell you something New Yorkers, never in my life have I had a problem that I did not see an ending to — I don’t see an ending to this,' the mayor said in his opening remarks at a town hall-style gathering on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. 'This issue will destroy New York City.'"

  <p>Records obtained through the Committee’s subpoenas to date reveal that the Bidens and their associates have received over $20 million in payments from foreign entities. Below is a timeline that details key dates in our investigation. The [abbreviated] main points of interest are:</p>
  <p><b>China</b></p>
  <ul>
  <li>On March 1, 2017—less than two months after Vice President Joe Biden left public office—State Energy HK Limited, a Chinese company, wired $3 million to a Biden associate’s account.</li><br>
  <li>After the Chinese company wired the Biden associate account the $3 million, the Biden family received approximately $1,065,692 over a three-month period in different bank accounts. Additionally, the CEFC Chairman gives Hunter Biden a diamond worth $80,000. Lastly, CEFC creates a joint venture with the Bidens in the summer of 2017.</li><br>
  <li>The timeline lays out the “WhatsApp” messages and subsequent wires from the Chinese to the Bidens of $100,000 and $5 million.</li><br>
  <li>The total amount from China, specifically with CEFC and their related entities, to the Biden family and their associates is over $8 million.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Ukraine</b></p>
  <ul>
  <li>Devon Archer joined the Burisma board of directors in spring of 2014 and was joined by Hunter Biden shortly thereafter.</li><br>
  <li>Both Biden and Archer were each paid $1 million per year for their positions on the board of directors.</li><br>
  <li>In December 2015, after a Burisma board of directors meeting, Zlochevsky and Hunter Biden “called D.C.” in the wake of mounting pressures the company was facing.</li><br>
  <li>Zlochevsky was later charged with bribing Ukrainian officials with $6 million in an attempt to delay or drop the investigation into his company.</li><br>
  <li>The total amount from Ukraine to the Biden family and their associates is $6.5 million.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Russia</b></p>
  <ul>
  <li>On February 14, 2014, a Russian oligarch and Russia’s richest woman, Yelena Baturina, wired a Rosemont Seneca entity $3.5 million.</li><br>
  <li>On March 11, 2014, the wire was split up: $750,000 was transferred to Devon Archer, and the remainder was sent to Rosemont Seneca Bohai, a company Devon Archer and Hunter Biden split equally.</li><br>
  <li>In spring of 2014, Yelena Baturina joined Hunter Biden and Devon Archer to share a meal with then-Vice President Biden at a restaurant in Washington, D.C.</li><br>
  <li>The total amount from Russia to the Biden family and their associates is $3.5 million.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Romania</b></p>
  <ul>
  <li>On September 28, 2015, Vice President Biden welcomed Romanian President Klaus Iohannis to the White House. Within five weeks of this meeting, a Romanian businessman involved with a high-profile corruption prosecution in Romania, Gabriel Popoviciu, began depositing a Biden associate’s bank account, which ultimately made their way into Biden family accounts.</li><br>
  <li>Popoviciu made sixteen of the seventeen payments, totaling over $3 million, to the Biden associate account while Joe Biden was Vice President. Biden family accounts ultimately received approximately $1.038 million.</li><br>
  <li>The total amount from Romania to the Biden family and their associates is over $3 million.</li>

  <p>"Mr. Archer also told the House panel that Hunter Biden 'called D.C.' to discuss pressure that Burisma was facing, with the alleged phone call coming after a Burisma board of directors meeting in December 2015.
    Not long afterward, then-VP Biden traveled to Ukraine and threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless Ukrainian officials agreed to fire then-prosecutor-general Viktor Shokin, who was accused of corruption. At the time, Mr. Shokin was leading an investigation into Bursima and its founder, Mykola Zlochevsky, while Mr. Biden was serving on the company’s board.<br><br>While President Biden has insisted that Mr. Shokin was fired due to long-standing corruption allegations, Mr. Shokin has said it was because he was investigating Burisma.
  'The truth is that I was forced out because I was leading a wide-ranging corruption probe into Burisma Holdings, a natural gas firm active in Ukraine, and Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, was a member of the Board of Directors,' Mr. Shokin told a European court in a sworn affidavit."

  <p>"Hunter Biden has claimed he was 'high or drunk' when he used his father’s name to pressure a Chinese business associate.
    The 54-year-old son of Joe Biden, the US president, made the statement as he appeared before congressional committees on Thursday as part of an impeachment investigation into his father.
    It appears to be a major admission by his team, who previously claimed that the screenshots of WhatsApp messages to a Chinese asset manager had been faked.
    While negotiating a six-figure energy deal in 2017, Hunter Biden reportedly told Henry Zhao that he was 'sitting here with my father and we would like to understand why the commitment made has not been fulfilled'"
