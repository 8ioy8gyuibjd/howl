  <p>"Former President Donald J. Trump said undocumented immigrants were 'poisoning the blood of our country' in a recent interview... 'Nobody has any idea where these people are coming from, and we know they come from prisons. We know they come from mental institutions and insane asylums. We know they’re terrorists. Nobody has ever seen anything like we’re witnessing right now. It is a very sad thing for our country. It’s poisoning the blood of our country. It’s so bad, and people are coming in with disease. People are coming in with every possible thing that you could have.'"

  <p>"More than 5,000 active-duty military troops will deploy to the southern border by the end of this week, Defense Department officials said on Monday, an escalation of a midterm election show of force against a caravan of Central American migrants that President Trump has characterized as an 'invasion of our country.'"

  <p>"Rarely used over the past few decades, the Trump administration relied on an interpretation of Title 42 to issue a public health order during the COVID-19 pandemic that authorized the rapid expulsion of migrants... The Title 42 process has allowed the U.S. to expel upward of two million migrants from the border including a surge of Haitian asylum seekers last year, Venezuelans who have been coming in larger numbers, and Mexicans, who make up the bulk unauthorized migrants in the Southwest."

  <p>"Almost obscured in the rancor over President Trump's immigrant crackdown at the southern border is the impact of his travel ban, upheld by the Supreme Court last week... It indefinitely suspends the issuance of immigrant and nonimmigrant visas to applicants from the Muslim-majority countries Libya, Iran, Somalia, Syria and Yemen - plus North Korea and Venezuela."

  <p>"The Trump administration is moving forward with a tough new asylum rule in its campaign to slow the flow of Central American migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. Asylum-seeking immigrants who pass through a third country en route to the U.S. must first apply for refugee status in that country rather than at the U.S. border."

  <p>"Ms. Carroll’s account of the alleged rape conveniently removed any witnesses, Mr. Tacopina [Trump's lawyer] said. She testified that the sixth floor of the department store was empty and the dressing room door was left unlocked... He also questioned how Ms. Carroll never told police about the alleged rape or spoke publicly about what happened for more than 20 years. The writer, who kept a diary her entire life, never documented the alleged attack, Mr. Tacopina said... Mr. Trump’s lawyer also noted that Ms. Carroll had joked on Facebook about having sex with Mr. Trump for money and said that she was a fan of 'The Apprentice,' the reality television show in which Mr. Trump previously served as the host."

  <p>"Letitia James fixated on Donald Trump as she campaigned for New York attorney general, branding the then-president a 'con man' and 'carnival barker' and pledging to shine a 'bright light into every dark corner of his real estate dealings.' Five years later, James is on the verge of disrupting Trump’s real estate empire after a judge ruled Tuesday that he defrauded banks, insurers and others by exaggerating the value of assets on paperwork used for deals and securing loans.<br><br>
    One such valuation, Engoron [the judge] concluded was inflated, was the Trump palace at Mar-a-Lago, the only property at Palm Beach to face the waterfront on both the ocean and the waterway. While Trump valued the property between $426 million and $612 million, the judge in New York claimed the estate was only worth between $18 and $28 million.<br><br>
    Much smaller properties in Palm Beach, however, have sold for far more than the local assessor’s evaluation. Rush Limbaugh’s former residence, for example, which rests on less than 3 acres, sold for $155 million despite being appraised at $51 million. Trump’s property at Mar-a-Lago spans 20 acres of prime real estate."

  <p>"I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard."

  <p>"The Presidential Records Act allows the president to decide what records to return and what records to keep at the end of his presidency. And the National Archives and Records Administration can’t do anything about it."
