  <p>"Intelligence is highly stable beginning in childhood, has not been permanently affected by interventions specifically designed to raise it, and has high (within-race) heritability. Shared environmental effects on intelligence wash away by late adolescence. IQ (intelligence quotient) differences can be traced to both genes (40%) and shared environments (25%) in early childhood, but genetic effects increase in importance with age (to 80% in adulthood) while shared effects dissipate."

  <p>"Employment options are virtually unlimited above IQ 120 to scant below IQ 80. Such options are virtually nonexistent today for individuals below IQ 70 to 75, the usual threshold for borderline mental retardation.
    <br><br>Individuals with IQ 80-83 are unlikely to benefit much from training in any formalized setting and will later need constant supervision using even simple tools. Even IQ 95 workers tend to need explicit teaching of most of what they need to know, and they do not benefit much from ‘book learning’ training. Better training technology might improve success rates for all groups, but it would not equalize them.
    <br><br>Although low-IQ adults’ child-rearing capabilities are surely below average, their parenting challenges tend to be greater. As a group, these are highly vulnerable individuals and families, especially in each other’s company.
    <br><br>The social adaptation of low-IQ individuals is greatly enhanced by certain personality traits, particularly persistence and a willingness to adhere to their community’s rules and norms. ‘Altruism’ and ‘conscientiousness’ seem to be the most important, but ‘courtesy,’ ‘sportsmanship,’ and ‘civic virtue’ are other documented factors. Low conscientiousness and low IQ are surely a disastrous combination. Individuals with below-average IQs might therefore benefit as much from efforts to enhance their citizenship behavior as their intellectual skills."

  <p>"There is a roughly one standard deviation (15-point) IQ gap between American Whites and Blacks, which is itself not a matter of dispute. Here, for example, are quotes from two of the most popular textbooks on intelligence: 'There is some variation in the results, but not a great deal. The African American means [on intelligence tests] are about one standard deviation unit...below the White means...'. And 'It should be acknowledged, then, without further ado that there is a difference in average IQ between blacks and whites in the USA and Britain'. Some researchers do contend that this gap has narrowed across the 20th century, but others dispute this, and it seems reasonable, given the preponderance of evidence, to suppose that the gap remains roughly one standard deviation.
    <br><br>Heritability is a measure of how much of the variance in a trait in a particular environment is caused by differences in genes. Cognitive ability is one of the most highly heritable psychological traits, often exceeding 70% in adult samples—meaning that 70% of the variance in intelligence (measured by IQ tests) is caused by differences in genes.
    <br><br>Even if discrimination against Blacks in some countries is widespread, this would not explain IQ and achievement gaps between ethnically homogenous countries, such as Iceland and Haiti, or between different demographic groups within multi-ethnic countries in which racial discrimination is not widespread, such as the UK, France, or Sweden.
    <br><br>Blacks in the United States trace most of their ancestry to Western Africa, but are somewhere between 15–25% admixed with Europeans. Thus, an 85 estimate of the mean IQ of Blacks in the United States is consistent with a roughly 75 IQ of Sub-Saharan Africans.
    <br><br>The hereditarian research tradition, as we see it, is a straightforward extension of the Darwinian tradition and makes the same basic scientific assumptions: humans are the products of natural and sexual selection; individuals vary in heritable traits; groups vary in heritable traits; intelligence is an adaptation; humans vary in intelligence; human groups vary in intelligence."

  <p>"Around the world, the average IQ for East Asians centers around 106; Whites about 100; Blacks about 85 in the United States and 70 in sub-Saharan Africa... In the United States, 15% to 20% of the Black IQ distribution exceeds the White median IQ, so many Blacks obtain scores above the White average. This same order of mean group differences is also found on ‘culture-fair’ tests and on reaction time tasks. Hundreds of studies on millions of people have confirmed the three-way racial pattern.
    <br><br>Most disputed is the validity of the low mean IQ scores reported for subSaharan Africans. Lynn’s (1991) review of 11 studies found a mean IQ of 70. A subsequent review of over two dozen studies by Lynn and Vanhanen (2002) found an average IQ of 70 for West, Central, East, and Southern Africa.
    <br><br>A study at South Africa’s University of the North found the highest scoring African sample to that date—147 first-year mathematics and science students who scored an IQ of 100. This higher score may reflect the fact that they were mathematics and science students, specially selected for admission to the university from a pool of 700 applicants on the basis of a math-science selection test.
    <br><br>Many critics claim that Western-developed IQ tests are not valid for groups as culturally different as sub-Saharan Africans. However, a review showed that test scores for Africans have about equal predictive validity as those for non-Africans (e.g., 0.20 to 0.50 for students’ school grades and for employees’ job performance).
    <br><br>Race differences in average brain size are observable at birth... Asian American children averaged larger cranial volumes than did the White children, who averaged larger cranial volumes than did the Black children. Within each race, cranial capacity correlated with IQ scores. By age 7, the Asian American children averaged an IQ of 110; the White children, 102; and the Black children 90. Because the Asian American children were the shortest in stature and the lightest in weight while the Black children were the tallest in stature and the heaviest in weight, these average race differences in brain-size/IQ relations were not due to body size... Matching Blacks and Whites for IQ eliminates the average difference in head size, but matching the groups on head size does not equalize their IQs. This is what one would expect if brain size is only one of a number of brain factors involved in IQ."

  <p>"The would-be censors of 'sensitive' intelligence research assert that the nation will be healthier by remaining ignorant of selected realities. They suggest that the truth, especially on racial differences in cognitive ability (genetic or not), can only do harm and that their untruths only good. Again, why should we think so? Intelligence researchers are willing to agree that disseminating information more widely may hold some risks, which is why they discuss how to minimize them. In contrast, the censors have yet to consider whether the collective fraud they nurture might also do harm. We have just seen one example where it could threaten public safety. And it may wreak more insidious, self-perpetuating damage to the body politic.
    <br><br>The media can keep repainting its libelous portrait of intelligence research only with the complicity of intelligence's mother field, psychology. Although intelligence tests are frequently cited as psychology's biggest success, psychology often treats researchers who study the origins and conseqeuences of individual and group differences in general intelligence as its biggest emarassment... In doing so, it has undermined the integrity of psychology science, encoruaged fiction-driven social policies that continue to disappoint and ratchet up blame, and blinded us to the daily risks and challenges faced by the less able among us.
    <br><br>The egalitarian fiction is that demographic groups do not differ meaningfully, on average, in important abilities and aptitudes: that is, whatever their current level of performance, all groups are equipotential, both now and in the future. Critics argue it would be demeaning and demoralizing to claim otherwise. The American black-white IQ difference is this fiction's key target. Data from large national samples shows that the black-white IQ gap is essentially the same at age three as later in life, and at the end of the twentieth century as at the beginning: about 1.1 standard deviations. The gap has ben impervious to social change, affirmative action, secular rises in IQ (the so-called Flynn effect), and endless educational interventions.
    <br><br>The presumption of equipotentiality directs all explanation of social inequalities toward mistreatment or inequalities in the the social environment. The fiction also guides much social policy. Unequal outcomes now trigger the presumption of guilt, which employers must then disprove. One man’s benevolent lie becomes another man’s impossible burden.
    <br><br>About 75% of White people vs. only 28% of Black people exceed the minimum IQ level (~IQ 91)—a ratio of 3 to 1—usually required for minimally satisfactory performance in the skilled trades, fire and police work, and mid-level clerical jobs such as bank teller. The potential pools become increasingly racially lopsided for more cognitively demanding jobs. Workers in professional jobs such as engineer, lawyer, and physician typically need an IQ of at least 114 to perform satisfactorily. About 23% of White people but only 1% of Black people exceed this minimum."
