  <p>"In line with the majority of previous studies, we find negative effects of statistical ethnic diversity on each of our five measures of neighborhood social cohesion: trust, collective efficacy, connectedness, reported social problems, and overall satisfaction with neighborhood life. With few exceptions these effects are statistically significant in all three countries and apply to natives and persons of immigrant origin very much alike."

  <p>"Across European regions, different aspects of immigration-related diversity are negatively related to social trust. In longitudinal perspective, an increase in immigration is related to a decrease in social trust. Immigration growth is particularly strongly associated with a decrease in social trust."

  <p>"Ethnocentrism is a nearly universal syndrome of attitudes and behaviors. The behaviors associated with ethnocentrism are cooperative relations with the in-group and absence of cooperative relations with the out-group. Ironically, the ability to discriminate can support the evolution of cooperation based on ethnocentric behavior."

  <p>"Simply having more diversity in a group is no guarantee that the group will make better decisions or function effectively. Empirical evidence suggests that diversity is most likely to impede group functioning. Diversity by itself is more likely to have a negative than positive effects on group performance. There is substantial evidence from both laboratory and field studies conducted over the past four decades that variations in group composition can have important effects on group functioning. These studies show that increased diversity, especially in terms of age, tenure, and ethnicity, typically have negative effects on social integration, communication, and conflict."

  <p>"We find that a small minority group will adopt majority cultural practices and integrate. In contrast, minority groups above a certain critical mass, may retain diverse practices and may also segregate from the majority. The size of this critical mass depends on the cultural distance between groups, the importance of culture in day to day life, and the costs of forming a social tie."

  <p>"Increasing diversity undermines attitudes among individuals who do not move. Individuals who move from a diverse to a homogeneous community report improved attitudes. However, there is no effect among individuals who move from a homogeneous to a diverse community. Prior preferences for/against out-group neighbours may condition diversity’s impact."

  <p>"We conducted a field experiment based on the lost-letter technique across 52 neighborhoods in Berlin, Germany. We find strong support for the negative effect of ethnic diversity on cooperation. We find no evidence, however, of in-group favoritism. Letters from Turkish or Muslim organizations were as often returned as those from German and Christian organizations, and the ethnic diversity effect was the same for all types of letters."

  <p>"This is the first study to our knowledge that makes use of a large panel dataset of several environmental indicators to explore links between ethnic/religious diversity and the environment. We find that all indices of social fragmentation are negatively linked to measures of environmental quality, although for some of them the size of the effect is larger in the case of polarisation."

  <p>"In agreement with contact theory, the paper initially finds a positive relation between diversity and inclusive attitudes on immigrants. However, this link disappears once controls for social background, gender and prior levels of the outcome are included in the model. This indicates that students with particular pre-enrolment characteristics have self-selected in diverse schools and that inclusive attitudes have stabilized before secondary education. Diversity further appears to have a negative impact on trust, irrespective of the number of controls added to the model."

  <p>"From a random start, ethnocentric strategies dominate other possible strategies (selfish, traitorous, and humanitarian) based on cooperation or non-cooperation with in-group and out-group agents. Here we show that ethnocentrism eventually overcomes its closest competitor, humanitarianism, by exploiting humanitarian cooperation across group boundaries as world population saturates. Selfish and traitorous strategies are self-limiting because such agents do not cooperate with agents sharing the same genes. Traitorous strategies fare even worse than selfish ones because traitors are exploited by ethnocentrics across group boundaries in the same manner as humanitarians are, via unreciprocated cooperation."

  <p>"Uniting worshippers of different races remains a challenging endeavor. Congregations that successfully attract worshippers of different races often have difficulty sustaining their multiracial composition. Differences in belonging and participation by racial group persist regardless of group size. Those who are a part of a congregation's largest racial group possess a stronger sense of belonging and participate at a deeper level than congregants of other races."

  <p>"We define artificial states as those in which political borders do not coincide with a division of nationalities desired by the people on the ground. We propose and compute for most countries in the world two measures of the degree to which borders may be artificial. One measures how borders split ethnic groups into two separate adjacent countries. The other measures the straightness of land borders, under the assumption the straight land borders are more likely to be artificial. We then show that these two measures are correlated with several measures of political and economic success."

  <p>"Contrary to earlier predictions, ethnic origin does retain some explanatory power in models of recent voting behavior, and ethnic cleavages have not been entirely replaced by economic divisions in the electorate. Although the settlement patterns of the more established and numerous nationality groups (i.e. Irish and Italians) are less associated with partisanship than they were 50 years ago, the political salience of white ethnicity persists, suggesting that ethnic groups do not simply dealign or politically “assimilate” over time. Some groups maintain a strong identity in spite of upward mobility because movement from city to suburbs is selected not just on housing, income or school characteristics, as is usually the case, but on ethnicity too. Towns with significant concentrations of specific European ancestry groups lean Republican, even after we have accounted for the presence of other sources of political leaning and past voting tendencies, while Democratic attachments are undeniably strong in towns where the newer immigrant groups have settled."

  <p>"Grounded in the idea that ethnocentrism facilitates within-group trust, cooperation, and coordination, we conjecture that ethnocentrism may be modulated by brain oxytocin, a peptide shown to promote cooperation among in-group members. Results show that oxytocin creates intergroup bias because oxytocin motivates in-group favoritism and, to a lesser extent, out-group derogation."

  <p>"We concluded that ethnic and linguistic diversity fractionalization variables, but not religious ones, are likely to be important determinants of economic success, both in terms of output (GDP growth), the quality of policies, and the quality of institutions. The democracy index is inversely related to ethnic fractionalization. This result suggests that in more fragmented societies, a group may impose restrictions on political liberty to maintain control over other groups. In more homogeneous societies, it is easier to rule more democratically since conflicts are less intense."

  <p>"The effects of a high concentration of immigrant children on the educational outcomes of native children vary from negative to zero, depending on the country. Native children tend to experience more incidents of bullying when there are more immigrant children in the same classroom. Immigrant children from privileged backgrounds have no detrimental effects on their native peers. In most countries, a high share of immigrant children in schools leads to lower test scores of native children. A high share of immigrant students can lead to higher dropout rates from high school and lower chances of passing exams."
