  <p>"Sweden has gone from being a low-crime country to having homicide rates significantly above the Western European average. This is mainly a phenomenon among men with immigrant backgrounds."

  <p>"The majority of men convicted of rapes and attempted rapes in the past five years were born overseas—more than 80% in assault rape cases where the perpetrator and victim were not previously acquainted. During the last decade, there was a 40% increase in rapes, from 5960 reported rapes in the year 2010 to 8350 reported rapes in the year 2019. In 2002, 85% of those sentenced to at least two years in prison for rape in a court of appeals were foreign born or second-generation immigrants.
    <br><br>The Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention found in 1996 that North African immigrants were 23 times as likely to commit rape as Swedish men; Iraqis 20x; Bulgarians and Romanians 18x; rest of Africa 16x; Iran, Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia 10x."

  <p>"A surge in drug-linked gang-violence in Sweden led to a 60% increase in bomb blasts in 2019. Some 257 bomb attacks were reported to police last year, up from 162 the previous year."

  <p>"95% of people involved with Stockholm organised crime had at least one parent born abroad. 41% of the criminals were born overseas. Both parents of 82% of gang members were foreign-born. The main country of origin for gang criminals was Iraq. Other over-represented nations included Somalia, Syria, and Turkey."

  <h2 id="demographics"><a href="#sweden#demographics" onclick="changeContent('sweden', 'demographics')"># Demographics</a></h2>
  <p>"Foreign-born residents have nearly doubled between 2000 and 2019. Nearly 20% of the Swedish population, or one in five people, were born outside of the country as of 2019. Sweden's population increased by 97,404 people last year. Migration represents around 73% of the increase.
    <br><br>Since 2015, the most common origin country for foreign-born residents has been Syria, Iraq second, Finland third. Last year, Pakistani migrants increased by 24.7%, while Syrian migrants halved. The most common country of origin from 2000-2015 was Finland. Over the last five years, Sweden accepted more than 400,000 asylum seekers and relatives of previous immigrants."

  <p>"Births of Swedish citizens, which had exceeded deaths by 22,000 in 1971, fell until natural decrease appeared in 1976. That gap has been growing wider ever since. At the end of 1981, 96% of Swedish citizens were born in Sweden."

  <p>"300,000 Muslim migrants arrived in Sweden from 2010-2016. Only Germany, the UK, France and Italy received more Muslim migrants since mid-2010. Sweden is home to fewer than 10 million people. In a sustained high migration scenario, roughly three-in-ten Swedes (30.6%) would be Muslim at midcentury. In a medium scenario, without any future refugee flows, Sweden would be expected to have the second-largest Muslim share in Europe (20.5%) as of 2050."

  <p>In 1975 the government passed an act on a new immigrant and minority policy that explicitly rejected the ideal of
    ethno-cultural homogeneity and the policy of assimilation. The explicit policy aim of the freedom of choice principle was to create the opportunity for ethno-cultural minority groups in Sweden to transgenerationally retain their own languages and cultures, a decidedly multiculturalist policy goal.
    <br><br>From the mid-1970s, the goal of enabling the preservation of ethnocultural minorities and creating a positive attitude towards the new publically endorsed multicultural society among the majority population became incorporated into Swedish cultural, educational and media policies."

  <p>"Sweden's generosity costs a fortune, at a time when economic growth is stagnant. The country now spends about $4-billion a year on settling new refugees, up from $1-billion a few years ago. And they keep coming. Sweden automatically accepts unaccompanied minors."

  <p>"In 2015, 163,000 asylum-seekers primarily from Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq arrived in Sweden. 60,000 received a residence permit. Of the 40,019 over the age of 15, only 4,574 get their livelihood from employment. 18,405 people from the cohort live on welfare handed out by municipalities and 9,970 people receive funds for studying.
    <br><br>Economist and professor Per Lundborg told Aftonbladet: 'Sweden is one of the most high-tech countries in the world, where we have cut simpler jobs. Therefore, the knowledge gap is too large for many of the refugee immigrants who come here.'
    <br><br>In Malmö, where unemployment is 13.7%, almost double the national average, the municipality is looking at a deficit of 390 million kroner ($40.2 million). 'This is something we share with many other municipalities. It is due to the demographic development, where fewer [people] have to provide for more,' the financial director of Malmö municipality, Anna Westerling, recently told the daily newspaper Sydsvenskan. At least 110 municipalities expect to run a deficit this year. (There are 290 municipalities and 21 regions in Sweden.)
    <br><br>In Ystad, to save money, the municipality will no longer serve hot meals to the elderly and cleaning services will be limited to once every three weeks. The elderly will instead have to get ready-made meals from the supermarket.
    <br><br>Motala municipality, according to a report in Aftonbladet, announced that it would lower the heat in buildings managed by the city, including old age homes, to save money. The criticism of the proposed savings, however, was so massive that the municipality had to back down."

  <p>"According to international conventions such as the United Nations Declaration on Rights of the Child and the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights, asylum-seeking children have to been treated in the same way as would needy children born in the countries of refuge. A large increase in unaccompanied minors may easily overstrain existing welfare infrastructure and lead to either reconfiguration and innovation or stagnation and possibly collapse.
    <br><br>In 2014, a major change in the law on newcomers’ reception allowed the SMA to allocate unaccompanied children to a municipality at will, even if local agreements that were required prior to the law’s amendment did not exist. The changes delegated to local governments all responsibilities for unaccompanied children before they are even granted a residence permit. These include organizing accommodation, health- and social-care services and access to school, as well as addressing other social needs such as family reunion.
    <br><br>A Swedish investigation into migrants claiming asylum as children suggests that three-quarters of those tested were over the age of 18. The Migration Agency has so far made 5,700 decisions on the basis of those assessments. In 79% of those cases, the agency decided to formally consider the applicant as older than they had initially claimed in their asylum application. More than 80,000 minors (of whom 37,000 arrived in the country without a parent or guardian) applied for asylum in Sweden in 2015 and 2016. 86% of unaccompanied minors who applied for asylum in 2015 were males claiming to be 13-17."
