  <p>"While America’s political kingmakers inject their millions into high-profile presidential and congressional contests, Democratic mega-donor George Soros has directed his wealth into an under-the-radar 2016 campaign to advance one of the progressive movement’s core goals — reshaping the American justice system. The billionaire financier has channeled more than $3 million into seven local district-attorney campaigns in six states over the past year — a sum that exceeds the total spent on the 2016 presidential campaign by all but a handful of rival super-donors.
    <br><br>His money has supported African-American and Hispanic candidates for these powerful local roles, all of whom ran on platforms sharing major goals of Soros’, like reducing racial disparities in sentencing and directing some drug offenders to diversion programs instead of to trial.
    <br><br>'The prosecutor exercises the greatest discretion and power in the system. It is so important,' said Andrea Dew Steele, president of Emerge America, a candidate-training organization for Democratic women. 'There’s been a confluence of events in the past couple years and all of the sudden, the progressive community is waking up to this.'"

  <p>"Soros famously made his fortune by massively shorting the British pound, leading to more than $1 billion in profits for him and economic calamity for the United Kingdom’s central bank. With his riches, Soros eventually became politically active in America as a major donor. He funded high-profile Democratic candidates for national office, and then shifted gears to focus intently on criminal justice.
    <br><br>Soros gambled that he could swing district attorney elections by heavily funding candidates who favored his version of justice, which focuses on de-prosecution and decarceration in the name of racial equity. Prosecutors like Larry Krasner in Philadelphia, Kim Foxx in Chicago, George Gascón in Los Angeles, and Alvin Bragg in New York rode Soros’s funding to victory.
    <br><br>Soros’s ultimate calculation was that he could make enough of these investments in radical prosecutors that it would cause a major shift in law enforcement in American cities. Once again, he proved prescient. Soros-backed candidates won elections in Manhattan, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Boston, Portland, San Francisco, St. Louis, Dallas, Tampa, Denver, Orlando, the Northern Virginia suburbs surrounding the District of Columbia, and other population hubs. By one calculation, 20 percent of the population of the United States was covered by Soros-funded prosecutors, with an even heavier concentration in the urban cores.
    <br><br>In wealthy cities with Soros-backed prosecutors, like San Francisco and Austin, property crimes rose dramatically. Once-idyllic cities like Portland, now under the jurisdiction of Soros-backed chief prosecutor Mike Schmidt, have suffered from rising violent crime and property crime... Cities under the influence of Soros-backed prosecutors are less safe than a decade ago. The promise of increased safety was an illusion."

  <p>"Between 2015 and 2019, Soros and his affiliated political action committees spent more than $17 million on local DA races in support of left-wing candidates, according to the Capital Research Center, a non-profit that tracks lobbying and charitable giving. That number is expected to top $20 million in the last two years, according to estimates from the NLPC.
    <br><br>Critics say the policies of Soros-funded DAs, which have included abolishing bail and, in the case of Chicago, placing hundreds of violent criminals on electronic tracking systems, have led to a spike in crime throughout the country. According to the FBI’s annual Uniform Crime Report released in September, the country saw a 30 percent increase in homicides in 2020 — the largest single-year spike since they began recording crime statistics 60 years ago. The report also saw a 24 percent decrease in arrests across the country. 
    <br><br>This year, Philadelphia, a city of 1.5 million, had more homicides than New York and Los Angeles, the country’s two largest cities. The city recorded 521 homicides — the highest since 1990 — compared to 443 in New York and 352 in Los Angeles. Chicago, the country’s third largest city, registered the highest number of homicides at 739, up three percent from the previous year."

  <p>"A new report is shedding light on how elevated crime has taken a toll on mid-size U.S. cities in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and the 'Defund the Police' movement.
    <br><br>In 2022, Pittsburgh reached its highest number of homicides in decades with 71. The city also saw a 46% increase in shootings from 2020 to 2021.
    <br><br>Tucson, Arizona saw 67 homicides in 2022, and non-fatal gun crimes increased by 19% from 2021 to 2022. Gun violence, drug abuse and homelessness all increased that year as well. 
    <br><br>Aggravated assaults nearly doubled in Henderson, Nevada in 2022. Robberies also jumped by 91% during the first seven months of that year.
    <br><br>Atlanta saw 31% more burglaries and 22% more motor vehicle thefts in 2022 than the year prior, according to the report. Aggravated assaults also increased to 3,465 from just 970 the year before.
    <br><br>Between 2020 and 2021, Milwaukee led the nation in car thefts after these crimes increased by 111%. The city saw an overall crime spike of 22.6% during the same period.

  <p>"America's retailers are seeing more losses from theft, which is increasingly taking on more aggressive forms.The National Retail Federation just released its annual security survey, which found so-called 'shrink' accounted for over $112 billion in losses last year. That’s an industry term for measuring inventory losses, which aren’t always a result of theft. Some losses stem from administrative or operational errors, for example. But theft accounts for essentially two-thirds of retail shrink... And such thefts are becoming more aggressive than ever before, said David Johnston, vice president of asset protection and retail operations for the National Retail Federation... '(The) majority of these are not stealing for need,' Johnston said. 'They're stealing for greed, knowing that they can go to ... some form of organized group to resell the merchandise and get it back into the marketplace.'
    <br><br>Target just announced it will close nine locations in four markets next month due to ongoing theft and 'fundamental challenges to operating these stores safely'... The survey found about 45% of retailers reduced some store hours in response to retail crime or violence, and 28% even closed locations... And another 67% reported an increase in repeat offenders in places where officials have reduced or eliminated cash bail."

  <p>"Hundreds of Pittsburgh Police officers are eligible to retire today, and no new officers are in the pipeline to replace them. On top of that, the city has seen a dramatic decline in the number of police applicants. Every month, officers are retiring or resigning, and the city has not hired any new officers in two years... due to a hiring freeze prompted by the 'Defund the police' movement and exacerbated by the pandemic financial crisis... The city has seen a dramatic decline in applicants, from more than 2,000 a decade ago to under 300 for each of the past two years.
    <br><br>Starting Monday, the city of Pittsburgh says it will no longer respond to 911 calls that are not related to 'in progress emergencies'... The city will create a 'Telephone Reporting Unit' (TRU) to dispatch calls that do not require an in-person response by officers... This means that calls related to crimes such as criminal mischief, theft, harassment and burglary alarms will all be handled by the TRU or other forms of online reporting."
